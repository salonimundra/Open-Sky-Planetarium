This code is used to test OSP plugin with NEMA17 motors and 2DM542 microstep driver. 

The connections for one motor are as under:
1. The pins A+ A- B+ and B- are connected with the four pins of NEMA17.
2. V+ and GND are connected to 24V power supply terminals. GND is shorted with the GND of Arduino. 
3. ENA- DIR- and PLS- are connected to GND of Arduino.
4. PLS+ --> D10 of Arduino.
5. DIR+ --> D11 of Arduino.
6. ENA+ --> D12 of Arduino. 
7. RS232 pins were completely OFF.
8. The swicthes on the drivers were adjusted for 3200 steps per revolution and 1A current supply.

Both the drivers were powered by a single 24V DC supply.
